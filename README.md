Summary of Findings
In the first part of the project I examined the data for drivers who received bar coupons.
To summarize the findings from this part of the study, drivers were more likely to accept
the bar coupons if they went to bars 1 or more times per month.
In addition, drivers were more like to accept the bar coupon if they did not have kids in the car.
They also appeared more likely to accept the bar coupon if they were between the ages of 21-30.

In the second part of the project I examined the data for drivers who receive a coupon for a more
expensive restaurant ($20-$50).  My analysis showed that age and gender were not big predictors of likelihood
to accept an expensive restaurant coupon.  
Drivers that typically go to expensive restaurants were much more likely to accept the coupon, and the percent
acceptance increased the more often they typically went. My analysis also showed that drivers with an income of
$25K or higher were more likely to accept the coupon, as were drivers with no college education.
Once of the biggest factors I discovered, in addition to frequency of visiting expensive restaurants, was the
passenger that the driver had in the car.  More specifically drivers who were in the car with their partner were
most likely to accept the coupon.  It did not seem to really matter whether or not they were married to their partner.

While the overall acceptance rate of these coupons was 44.6% among all drivers who received them, among drivers who
visited expensive restaurants at least once a month, earned $25K or higher and were with their partner in the car, 
the acceptance rate was 73.9%

The next steps would be to:
1) Do some further analysis on both the bar and expensive restaurant categories to look for additional differences
 in which drivers accept and reject these coupons
2) Explore the other coupon categories to determine differences in which drivers accept and reject those types of coupons.
3) Determine if certain types of coupons will be more successful overall or if all of these types of coupons should be
 sent to drivers.
